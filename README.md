# clj-graph

Performs a variety of network graph operations, with an emphasis
on those that are useful for social network analysis. 

See also 
[clojure.contrib.graph](http://richhickey.github.com/clojure-contrib/graph-api.html), 
which provides a different set of operations with a different graph representation.

## Usage

For now, read the source code - it's short.

I'll add more helpful instructions later.
